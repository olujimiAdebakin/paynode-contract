## Overview
PayNode is an innovative non-custodial payment aggregation protocol designed for intelligent, parallel settlement routing across multiple off-chain liquidity providers. It revolutionizes traditional settlement by broadcasting proposals simultaneously to eligible providers, with the first to accept executing the order. This system leverages on-chain smart contracts to manage orders, provider intents, and secure settlements, while an off-chain aggregator optimizes routing based on provider tiers, capacity, and performance.

## Features
*   ‚ú® **Parallel Settlement**: Enables multiple liquidity providers to race for order acceptance, ensuring rapid and efficient settlements.
*   üîí **Non-Custodial Escrow**: User funds are securely held in escrow within the smart contract until settlement, guaranteeing trustless operations.
*   üß† **Tier-Based Intelligent Routing**: Facilitates optimized off-chain routing through an aggregator that considers provider tiers, capacities, and reputation scores.
*   ‚è±Ô∏è **Timelocked Upgrades**: Critical contract upgrades are secured with a 48-hour timelock via `PayNodeAdmin`, preventing instantaneous or malicious changes.
*   üîê **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained permissions managed by `PayNodeAccessManager` assign specific roles (e.g., Admin, Operator, Aggregator) for secure protocol governance.
*   üö® **Emergency Pause**: Includes a critical "kill switch" mechanism allowing administrators to pause protocol operations in emergencies.
*   üö´ **Provider Blacklisting**: System for flagging and blacklisting fraudulent or non-performing liquidity providers to maintain network integrity.
*   üìà **Provider Reputation System**: Tracks successful orders, failed orders, and settlement times to build a robust reputation score for providers.
*   üîó **Chainlink Automation Integration**: Utilizes Chainlink Keepers to automate the execution of scheduled upgrades and other time-sensitive protocol actions.
*   üîÑ **Upgradeable Architecture**: Implements the UUPS proxy pattern for seamless and secure contract upgrades without disrupting ongoing operations.

## Getting Started
To get the PayNode Protocol smart contracts running locally, follow these steps. This project uses [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/), a blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development.

### Installation
First, ensure you have Foundry installed. If not, follow the instructions [here](https://getfoundry.sh/).
Once Foundry is set up, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# ‚¨áÔ∏è Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/olujimiAdebakin/paynode-contract.git

# üìÇ Navigate into the project directory
cd paynode-contract

# üì¶ Install project dependencies (git submodules for OpenZeppelin, Chainlink, etc.)
forge install
git submodule update --init --recursive

# üî® Build the contracts
forge build

# üß™ (Optional) Run tests
forge test
```

### Environment Variables
For deployment, key addresses and configuration values need to be provided. While not traditional "environment variables" for a runtime application, these are essential deployment parameters that define the initial state and access of the smart contract system.

## API Documentation
The PayNode Protocol exposes a robust set of smart contract interfaces as its on-chain API, enabling secure and automated interactions for users, liquidity providers, and administrators.

### Base URL
The PayNode Protocol operates as a decentralized backend. Interactions occur via direct calls to the deployed smart contract addresses on the blockchain, rather than a centralized HTTP base URL. Each contract serves as a distinct module of the protocol's API.

### Endpoints

#### `PGateway.registerIntent`
Registers a liquidity provider's intent to process payments, detailing their available capacity, preferred fees, and commitment window.

**Request**:
```solidity
function registerIntent(
    string calldata _currency,
    uint256 _availableAmount,
    uint64 _minFeeBps,
    uint64 _maxFeeBps,
    uint256 _commitmentWindow
) external
```
*   `_currency` (`string`): The currency code (e.g., "NGN", "USD").

```solidity
function scheduleUpgrade(
    address target,
    address newImplementation

function performUpkeep(
    bytes calldata performData
) external
```
*   `performData` (`bytes`): Encoded data (typically the `target` proxy address) provided by Chainlink Automation's `checkUpkeep` function.

**Response**:
On successful execution, an `UpkeepPerformed` event is emitted, followed by an `UpgradeExecuted` event after the proxy is updated.
```solidity
event UpkeepPerformed(uint256 lastUpkeepTime);
event UpgradeExecuted(
    address indexed target,
    address indexed newImplementation,
    uint256 executedAt,
    address indexed caller,
    bool isAutomated
